%xfont "font"
%xfont "font" "registry"
    <font> :: use X11's <font> to draw characters.
    "font" is for specifying X11 XLFD, font alias name, or
    "family-weight-slant".
    "registry" is for specifying "registry-encoding".

    interpretation of "registry":
    - If none specified, "iso8859-1" is assumed.
    - If no dash inside, encoding of "*" is assumed.
      Therefore, you'll get "REGISTRY-*".
    - If there's a single dash inside, use specified value.
      Therefore, you'll get "REGISTRY-SPECIFIED".

    interpretation of "font":
    - If it has no dash inside,
        Try font alias, such as "8x5" or "a14".
        If there's no font alias matched, it should be "times" or
        something like that. In this case, try
        "-*-FONT-*-*-*-*-SIZE-*-*-*-*-*-REGISTERY-SPECIFIED".
    - If it has single dash inside, such as "times-medium":
        Try "-*-FONT-NAME-*-*-*-SIZE-*-*-*-*-*-REGISTRY-SPECIFIED".
    - If it has two dash inside, such as "times-medium-r":
        Try "-*-FONT-NAME-SPECIFIED-*-*-SIZE-*-*-*-*-*-REGISTRY-SPECIFIED".
    - Otherwise, try the specified string itself as XLFD.

    Some exercises:
    %xfont "times"
        You'll get "-*-times-*-*-*-*-SIZE-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1".
    %xfont "mincho" "jisx0208.1983"
        You'll get "-*-mincho-*-*-*-*-SIZE-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-*".
    %xfont "mincho-medium-r" "jisx0208.1983"
        You'll get "-*-mincho-medium-r-*-*-SIZE-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-*".

    NOTE: Only the following items are meaningful as "registry".
        jisx0208.1983-*
        gb2312.1980-*
        ksc5601.1987-*
        iso8859-1
        iso8859-2
        iso8859-3
        iso8859-4
    It would be nice if we can support "adobe-specific" for symbols,
    however, we have no escape sequence to designate the it...

%vfont "font"
    <font> :: use VFlib's <font> to draw Kanji characters.

%tfont "font"
    <font> :: use TrueType font <font> to draw ASCII characters.
        <font> can be full pathname, or just filename.  Use %tfdir
        for setting default font directory.

%tmfont "font"
    <font> :: use TrueType font <font> to draw Kanji characters.
        <font> can be full pathname, or just filename.

%tfont0 "font"
    <font> :: use TrueType font <font>, if none of the font specified by
        %tfont directive is found.  This is the last-resort for the
        TrueType font finding code.
        (allowed in ~/.mgprc, without "%" sign)

%bar <color> <width> <start> <length>
    <color> :: color of bar, foreground color will be used as default.
    <width> :: permill of display height. default 10.
    <start> :: start position percent of display width. default 0.
    <length> :: length percent of display width. default 100.

%valign "top|center|bottom"
    vertical alignment of images with current text line

%image "imagefile" <numcolor> <xzoomrate> <yzoomrate> <zoomflag>
%image "imagefile" [ [<numcolor>] <screensize> ]
    "imagefile" :: name of image file
    <numcolor> :: number of colors, 0 means no reduction.
    <xzoomrate> :: height percentage against physical display or original
            size, 0 means the original height.
    <yzoomrate> :: width percentage against physical display or original
            size, 0 means the original width.
    <zoomflag> :: 0 means zoomrate is against physial display
            others mean zoomrate is against original size

    <screensize> :: auto resizing.
            specify the original screen size by WIDTHxHEIGHT.
            unless screensize is the same size of the physical
            display, zoomrate is calculated automagically.

    Note that if the image is a binary image, current foreground
    and background colors are applied to the drawn image.

%newimage [options] "imagefile"

    Same as %image, but it is much easier to understand.
    options include:
        -colors numcolors
        -xysize piel pixel
        -zoom percentage
        -xyzoom x-percentage y-percentage
        Percentage is against the original image.
        "100" means the original image size, "50" means
        half the original image size.
        -scrzoom percentage
        -xscrzoom percentage
        -yscrzoom percentage
        -xyscrzoom x-percentage y-percentage
        Percentage is against the screen. "100" means screen
        width/height, "50" means half the screen width/height.
        -xscrzoom and -yscrzoom scales image with aspect
        ratio unchanged.

    TODO: supersede %image by %newimage?
    TODO: option for auto resize mode (fit image into the room left on
        the screen)

%prefix "string"
    Place "string" at the beginning of line.
    "string" should be a set of blank characters (\040).

    The effect of %prefix command in %tab command is local to
    tab-indented line.

%prefix <percentage>
    specify prefix spacing by <percentage> of the drawing area width.

    The effect of %prefix command in %tab command is local to
    tab-indented line.

%icon <arc|box|delta1|delta2|delta3|delta4|dia> <color> <size>
%icon <imagefile> <color> <size>
    add an icon for itemizing lines.
    for example,
        %tab 1 size 5, icon box green 50
    gives you an green box on the leftmost column of line.
    size is the percentage against the current character size.

%bimage "imagefile" [ <screensize> ]
    Specify the name of background image file
    <screensize> :: auto resizing.
            specify the original screen size by WIDTHxHEIGHT.
            unless screensize is the same size of the physical
            display, zoomrate is calculated automagically.

%default <linenum> <list-of-directives>
    Unless nodefault directive is specified, the directives in the
    argument is prepended to the directives of the linenum'th line
    in every page. The syntax of <list-of-directives> is a comma
    separated directives.
    This directive has to be placed in the preamble.

%tab <tabnum> <list-of-directives>
    Apply list of directives, if any of the lines start with tabnum
    tabs.
    This directive has to be placed in the preamble.

%tab <id> <list-of-directives>
    Apply list of directives, if any of the lines start with "&id".
    This directive has to be placed in the preamble.

%page
    A new page starts

%vgap <gapsize>
    Specify vertical gap size of each line
    <gapsize>:: percentage against current character size
        vertical gap = vertical font size * gapsize / 100

%hgap <gapsize>
    Specify horizontal gap size of each line
    <gapsize>:: percentage against current character size
        horizontal gap = vertical font size * gapsize / 100
    NOTE: horizontal gap is calculated based on vertical size,
    because fonts are proportional (horizontal size varies by code point).

%pause
    Stop drawing until forward key or button is pressed

%mark
    Mark the current position on the screen, so that we can come back
    later by %again.
    NOTE: mark is local to a page.  mark will be cleared at the page
    boundary.

%again
    Move current position to the location marked by %mark.

%system "command"
    Fork&exec the specified program.
    NOTE: the program will be invoked every time the page is redrawn.
    It sometimes annoy you.  it needs some rework.

    Special translation for presentation-window-relative geometry:
        Argument that starts with "%" will be translated as if
        it was interpreted relative to presentation window.

        "xeyes -geometry %50x50+25+25"  will be translated
        so that eyes appear on the center of the presentation window.

    The command has to be placed on a line alone.
    Do not use commas.

    Process will be killed when you leave the page.

%system "command" <page>
    Almost same as above.
    Process will be killed when you leave the specified <page>.
    If you set <page> to -1, the process will be killed when MagicPoint
    is terminated. (of course, you can terminate the child process alone
    by yourself)

%filter "command"
TEXT
%endfilter
    Fork&exec the specified program, feed TEXT into that process
    from standard input.  use the standard output from the process
    as presentation input.
    Do not forget to place %endfilter.

    The command has to be placed on a line alone.
    Do not use commas.

%vfcap "filename"
    Specifies VFlib configuration filename.
    (allowed in ~/.mgprc, without "%" sign)

%tfdir "dir"
    Specifies where to find TrueType font by default.
    (allowed in ~/.mgprc, without "%" sign)

%deffont "fontname" <list-of-directives>
    Define a symbolic fontname, by using list-of-directives.
    The directive must appear in the preamble.

    For example, you may want to define a typewriter-like font as:
        %deffont "typewriter" xfont "courier", tfont "cour.ttf"
    By using the above definition, you can make your presentation file
    less dependent to the configuration of magicpoint binary.
    If the configuration allows the use of TrueType "cour.ttf" font,
    "tfont" directive will be effective.  If there's no TrueType font
    available, or FreeType library is not compiled into the magicpoint
    binary you are currently using, "xfont" will be effective.

    "%font" cannot be used in "%deffont".  this is for avoiding infinite
    loops.

%font "fontname"
    Invoke the symbolic fontname defined by %deffont directive.

%embed "filename"
%endembed
    Embedded image support.  uuencoded data fragment can be put between
    the directives.
    NOTE: this directive is not for human beings.  use "mgpembed" command.

%noop
    No operation

%pcache <flag> <mode> <effect> <value>
    <flag> :: enable or disable forward page cache
            0 means disable forward page cache
            1 means enable forward page cache
    <mode> :: cache mode
            0 means caching is executed after 2seconds idle.
            1 means caching is executed immediately.
    <effect> :: type of 'special effect' for the forward page cache (0-2)
    <value> ::  speed of 'special effect'. value 1 means the highest speed.

%anim "filename"
    display animation file. (currently, only mng format is supported.)

%charset "registry"
    Specify the encoding of the document.
    At this moment, the following charset are supported.
        iso8859-1
        iso8859-2
        iso8859-3
        iso8859-4

%area <width> <height> [<xoffset> <yoffset>]
    Specify the drawing area within the window.  All parameters are
    translated as relative value of the window.  If offset is not
    specified, the drawing area will be put center.
    Note that all relative size specified in other directive after
    "%area" will be affected, i.e. it will be relative to the
    width/height of the drawing area instead of the window.

%opaque <value>
    <value> :: transparency of the font. (0-100)
    Value 0 means that the font will be drawn with full tranparency.
    NOTE: To use this directive, you need to build mgp with Xft2.
